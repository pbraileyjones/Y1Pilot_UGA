This contains the majority of outputs generated through running the workflows associated with this repository. I have removed some outputs that are innapropriate to store on github, but can be reproduced as part of the workflows provided.

### Amplicon Workflow

- #### *rawrunXXX*:
  - raw DNA sequences are not stored here. They have been submitted to NCBI [TO DO]
- #### *filtered*:
  - Folder is produced during the workflow but absent here. It would otherwise contain the cutadapt trimmed sequences.
- #### *dada2outputs:*
  - I have removed the *dadaF* and *dadaR* RDS file outputs that would be generated during this because they hold multiple GB of data.

### Backbone Phylogeny Workflow
