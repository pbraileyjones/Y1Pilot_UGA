#-------------------------- Database download ---------------------------------
 
# My script actually downloads all of them for all possible purposes, I'm using the LSU database GENERAL database
# It also:
#     - creates subset databases containing fungal only and glomeromycota only
#     - reformats longread (SSU-ITS-LSU) QIIME2 database:
#              - Converts lower case values to uppercase, I've had trouble running taxonomy assignment with upper case values
#              - Removes sequence entries containing "-" values, they also don't play nice with QIIME2

# Run download script
sbatch scripts/eukaryomedl.sh


#------------------------ Subset minimal database -----------------------------

# The EUKARYOME database is BIG, and performing phylogenetics on all of it is best left to the people who maintain it!
# I will take a subset to make a tree to decorate with our ASV sequences
# We subset ONE ENTRY for each unique genus/species combination to construct a backbone phylogeny

# Run subset script
sbatch scripts/eukaryomesubset.sh

#--------------------------- Align sequences ----------------------------------

# I align my sequences using the E-INS-i option in mafft
# This matches the most up-to-date AMF taxonomy papers (e.g., doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1320014)
# This is moreso used for 45S alignments, as it allows large gaps for unalignable regions (ITS!), but it is also quite a sensitive alignment option
